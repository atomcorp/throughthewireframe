## Why use Through the Wireframe?

The benefit of Through the Wireframe is it doesn't care what your html, css or js is doing. 

You can build an early mockup or prototype for a client or boss, to demonstrate UI or a feature using real HTML and JS. Rapidly prototype with flexbox and drop in something like jQuery or [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for facier stuff. Or not. Through the Wireframe just gives you a quick way to ensure whatever you make *looks* like a prototype.

Only tested on latest Chrome on Windows, so far.
