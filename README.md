## Why use Through the Wireframe?

The benefit of Through the Wireframe is it doesn't care what you html, css or js is doing. You can build an early mockup or prototype for a client or boss, to demonstrate UI or a feature, but by using the kits classes you have a quick way of building a page that won't feature distracting design. This leaves you with lots more time for working on UI or adding JS transitions for example, but still be confident you'll have a visually understandable page for your demonstration.
